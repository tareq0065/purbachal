                <p className="p1"><strong>RAJUK Purbachal New Town</strong></p>
                <p className="p1">Keeping in mind the expanding capital, the government took initiative to expand the
                    city of Dhaka long ago. Since then, RAJUK has been aspiring for land in the Purbachal project.
                    Because this whole city is being built keeping in mind the pressure of the growing population and
                    the future. The government's plan is to establish Purbachal as a completely pollution-free, modern,
                    model area where all the amenities of urban life will be within reach.</p>
                <p className="p2"><strong>Increased capital</strong></p>
                <p className="p1">Almost everything in Bangladesh is Dhaka-centric. So while planning for RAJUK
                    Purbachal, the planners designed it as an extended capital. Various government departments,
                    commercial areas, diplomatic areas, what is not in the plan! It is safe to say that this 6,000-acre
                    area is going to be an expanded capital.</p>
                <p className="p1"><strong>Location</strong></p>
                <p className="p1">The RAJUK Purbachal project is located in an area surrounded by Shitalakshya and Balu
                    rivers. A large part of it fell in Rupganj of Narayanganj and the rest in Kaliganj of Gazipur.
                    Divided into 30 separate sectors, more than 20 percent of the project is earmarked for commercial,
                    educational, and sports institutions. About 28 percent will have roads, sidewalks, and ancillary
                    infrastructure, and more than 13 percent will be used for lakes, parks, and beautification.</p>
                <p className="p1"><strong>Current status</strong></p>
                <p className="p1">Development work is in full swing in Purbachal at present. About 80 percent of the
                    land development work is nearing completion. Out of 25016 plots allotted, more than 13 thousand
                    plots have already been handed over to the owners. Almost all the preparations for the construction
                    of roads and bridges have already been completed. The next plan is to stockpile adequate LP gas in
                    30 sectors to ensure the supply of LP gas cylinders in each sector.</p>
                <p className="p1">The Bangladesh Navy has been tasked with constructing 72 bridges under the RAJUK
                    Purbachal project, of which more than 30 have already been constructed. The work of the rest is also
                    going on fast. Work on the famous 300-foot expressway connecting Pragati Sarani and Airport Road has
                    been completed.</p>
                <p className="p1">So much for the development on a large scale, at the individual level, many of those
                    who have been allotted plots have started taking possession of their own land. Along with building a
                    boundary wall on their plots, many have started planting trees here and cultivating various conch
                    shells on a small scale.</p>
                <p className="p2"><strong>Future plans</strong></p>
                <p className="p1">Many commercial establishments, offices, and government offices, including the fire
                    service headquarters, will be relocated to Purbachal. Two police lines and four police stations will
                    be set up considering the overall security of the area.</p>
                <p className="p1">There are also plans to build a 142-story building on 75 acres of land in Purbachal.
                    It will be a very high facility and will have an international conference center and sports complex
                    with many other facilities. Talks with the Kali Pradeep Chowdhury Group of the United States on the
                    issue have come a long way.</p>
                <p className="p1">Apart from this, the master plan with this thought in mind, the housing project is
                    also in the future plan. About 36% of the entire project area will be used for housing projects.
                    72,000 flats will be constructed on 90 acres of land for low and middle-income people. That is why
                    RAJUK Purbachal is going to be an absolutely adorable area for the common man and everyone involved
                    in the housing industry.</p>
                <p className="p1"><strong>Why RAJUK Purbachal project is attractive to all concerned in the housing
                    sector of the country</strong></p>
                <p className="p1">With the proposed 300 feet Purbachal Highway, 160 feet Dhaka City Bypass Road, 150
                    feet Dhaka-Sylhet Highway and the proposed 300 feet highway from Purbachal Kanchan Bridge to
                    Dhaka-Sylhet Highway, travel from Dhaka city to this area will definitely be much easier. It will
                    also save a lot of time.</p>
                <p className="p1">Designed and planned by a combination of experienced and renowned architects,
                    engineers, urban planners, and environmentalists, this state-of-the-art project will have all the
                    elements of modern living. To get rid of the biggest problem of Dhaka city, unimaginable traffic
                    congestion, this project has 30, 40, 60, and even 60 feet wide internal roads.</p>
                <p className="p1">It is natural that all real estate companies will have a huge interest in such an
                    area. Many projects are being developed in the vicinity for this purpose.</p>
                <p className="p1">Work on the RAJUK Purbachal project is progressing faster than any other area in
                    Dhaka. Needless to say, Dhaka city will change a lot in the next 10 years. And Purbachal will be the
                    center of that change.</p>
